### Problem
A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
A[0] = 5, A[1] = 4, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, A[4] = 1, A[5] = 6, A[6] = 2.

One of the longest S[K]:
S[0] = {A[0], A[5], A[6], A[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
```

### Discussion
Same as the DFS, but can be accomplished without recursion stack.
1. Loop every element as the start.
2. Find next element A[A[i]] until reach start.

### Solution
1. DFS (Time Limit Exceeded) $O(n^2)$, $O(nlogn)$

2. Brute Force (Leetcode solution) $O(n^2)$, $O(n)$

3. Mark Visited (Leetcode solution) $O(n)$, $O(n)$

Based on:
  * No duplicate elements.
  * Checking ring.
Mark array: visiting element only once.

4. Optimize Space (Leetcode solution) $O(n)$, $O(n)$

```python
class Solution:
    def arrayNesting(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxl = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):          
            start = i
            tmp = 1
            while(nums[start] != -1 and nums[start] != i):
                t = nums[start]
                nums[start] = -1
                start = t
                tmp += 1
            if tmp > maxl: maxl = tmp
        return maxl
```
